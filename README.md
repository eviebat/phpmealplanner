Summary:
This application is used to plan a weeks worth of meals. Start with the homepage.php file to begin your meal planning.
All of the meal files are sorted by type of meal (breakfast, lunch etc). If you link to any of the other files from anywhere but the homepage.php you will recieve an error and it will link you back to the
homepage.php file. Once you've created your menu, you can select to save it or start over. All of the meals are selected at random. If you return to the homepage after having saved your meal, you will lose it unless also printed or save somewhere else. This application does not currently allow for the editing of the meal files.
